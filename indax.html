    Water is one of the most important substances for life on Earth to function. 
    It is equally important for humans as well as animals. 
    Water does not merely help us survive, 
    but it is significant for our day-to-day functioning. 
    It has numerous uses when we come to think about it. 
    The majority of our Earth is covered with water itself, but, 
    not all of it is safe for consumption. 
    Therefore, it makes it essential for us to utilize this transparent chemical substance wisely.
    Moreover, if we look at the shortage of water happening in our country,
    it makes it all the more important to conserve it immediately.
